    /// By default, the view's layer is used to create the image mask; however, in certain situations where the view
    /// is transparent, this may not be wanted (e.g. radio buttons).

    /// is drawn, which can be any thread of your app. Therefore, the method must be safe to call from any thread.

    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - drawingRect: The destination rectangle in which to draw. The rectangle passed in is the `bounds` of `view`.
    ///                  The coordinates of this rectangle are specified in points.
    ///   - cgContext: The graphics context to use to draw.
